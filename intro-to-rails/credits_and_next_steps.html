    <div class="message">
        <p>Guess what? <em><strong>You're done!!!</strong></em> Congratulations, you just "finished" your first rails app!</p>

        <p>(They're never <em>really</em> ever finished... have fun tweaking it!)</p>

        <h1>Extra Credit</h1>

        <p>If you got all the way through with some time to spare, here's some extra stuff you can try:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Put your web application online by <a href="http://docs.railsbridgeboston.org/intro-to-rails/deploying_to_heroku">deploying to heroku</a>.</li>
            <li>Add a downvote button that does the opposite of what the upvote button does</li>
            <li>Sort topics by their number of votes</li>
            <li>Add an 'about' page, linked from the bottom of the topics list. Link back to the Topics list from the About page so users don't get stranded.</li>
            <li>If your class has a <strong>lot</strong> of time left over:

                <ul>
                    <li>Users should be allowed to vote only once: give votes a user_id and allow a user to have voted on each topic only once. But wait, what is a 'user' in our system? Get a volunteer to introduce everyone to <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a>, a simple way to add authentication to a Rails application.</li>
                    <li>Users should be able to give a post a 'negative' vote instead of a positive one. How might you represent that in this system?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h1>Authors</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Sarah Allen</li>
        <li>Sarah Mei</li>
        <li>Alex Chaffee</li>
        <li>Ryan Davis</li>
        <li>Steven! Ragnarok</li>
        <li>...and many, many others</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What next?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Probably time for the closing presentation.</li>
        <li>After that, start a project, tutorial, and come back again!</li>
        <li>
