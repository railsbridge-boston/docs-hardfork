        <h3>Goal</h3>

        <p>To teach you Ruby on Rails we are going to use a "Real World"
            example. You've decided to create a voting system for you and your
            friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to
            allow users to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>view the topics sorted by number of votes</li>
            <li>vote on topics</li>
            <li>create, edit, and destroy topics</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You've sketched up an initial screenshot of what you want it to look like:</p>

        <p><img class="screenshot" src="../img/finished_app.png" alt="Browser window with topic titles that can be voted on, ordered by number of votes"></p>

        <h3>Meta-Goal</h3>

        <p>When you have completed today's goal of getting the basic
            application online you should understand:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Basic Ruby syntax</li>
            <li>How to try your Ruby code (irb)</li>
            <li>How to go from requirements to a new working Rails application</li>
            <li>How to get your application online</li>
            <li>The basic tools a RoR developer uses (source control, editor, console, local server)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>To get through this course, you'll need a free Github account.</p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/signup" target="_blank">Create a free Github account</a> by filling the signup form.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../img/codespaces1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            On the next screen, you can click "skip personalization" on the bottom to continue.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../img/codespaces2.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you are signed into Github, you'll need to create a <strong>repository</strong> - a new programming project. <br><br>
            To do that,
            <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/start/generate" target="_blank">Create a new repository</a> from the Railsbridge template.
            You can pick any name you like, or accept the default suggestion. You can also decide if you want your code to be public
            for anyone to see, or private. <br><br>Leave the "Include all branches" option unchecked, then click <strong>Create repository</strong>.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../img/codespaces5.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            It may take a moment for your repository to be generated.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../img/codespaces6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            When it's finished, you'll be taken to a page that looks like this. Click on the green <strong>Code</strong> button,
            then click <strong>Create codespace on main</strong>. This will be our code editor.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../img/codespaces7.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            This will begin setting up the editor in your browser. It may take a minute or two.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../img/codespaces8.png" />
        </p>
        <p>
            The editor will automatically set up like this once it's ready.<br>
            <img class="screenshot" src="../img/codespaces9.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
            Congratulations! You're ready to start coding.

        <h1>Working Effectively and Efficiently</h1>

        <p>We highly recommend you do the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In your codespace you will want to open 2 terminal tabs:
                <ul>
                    <li>One is for regular terminal stuff</li>
                    <li>One will be for the Rails console. We'll explain later.</li>
                </ul>
                To do this:
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the "+" icon highlighted here: <br><img class="screenshot" src="../img/terminal-tabs1.png" /></li>
                    <li>This will create a new terminal tab, and open a panel where you can switch between them: <br><img class="screenshot" src="../img/terminal-tabs2.png" /></li>
                </ul>
                If you accidentally close your terminal, you can bring it back with <strong>Ctrl + `</strong>. On most keyboards the ` key is the key above Tab, and below Esc.
            </li>
            <li>Open your browser fresh or hide any windows you already have open.
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring up one window with two tabs.</li>
                    <li>One for this content.</li>
                    <li>One for interacting with your app.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Hide all extra applications. Turn off Twitter, IM, and all other distractions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By minimizing the number of things you interact with, you reduce the
            amount of time spent switching between them and the context lost as
            you work through the lessons. Having 50 tabs open in your web
            browser gets confusing and wastes time.</p>
