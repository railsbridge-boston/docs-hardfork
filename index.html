    <p>The "classic" RailsBridge curriculum (sometimes named Suggestotron). Takes you step-by-step through making a Rails app, one command at a time, using helpers
        like <code>rails generate scaffold</code>, and deploying that app to the Internet.</p>

<h1>FAQs</h1>

<h3>Can I use the RailsBridge curricula at my event?</h3>

<p>Anyone can use this site! It's under a Creative Commons license (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC-BY, specifically</a>), which means you're welcome to share, remix, or use our content commercially. We just ask for attribution.</p>

<p>Slightly different: if you're organizing an event and wonder if it could be considered a RailsBridge Workshop, we have two requirements:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The event should be free of charge.</li>
    <li>The event should target a group of people that is underrepresented in tech, such as LGBTQ folks, women, black or latin@ people, or others.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not doing those two things, you can totally still use the site, we just ask that you not call your event a RailsBridge workshop.
    (Charity workshops have used "Rails Workshop featuring the RailsBridge curriculum" in the past, which is neat.)</p>

<h3>I want to help, but I don't know how.</h3>

<p>First, <a href="https://github.com/">make a GitHub account</a>. Then,
    <a href="https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/docs/issues">create an issue</a> with the
    idea you have. We'll help you turn it into reality (assuming it's in line with
    our lofty goals :D).
</p>

<p>Don't know what you could work on? Browse the

<h3>I have a different question about RailsBridge.</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.railsbridge.org">RailsBridge website</a> probably has an answer!</p>
