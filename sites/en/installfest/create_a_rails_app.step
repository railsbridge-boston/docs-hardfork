Let's look at the structure of the whole project.

You can see the project directory when you're using Sublime Text. This is
convenient when you're going to edit several files and want to navigate quickly.

Open the suggestotron folder as a project in Sublime Text by clicking the
Project menu and selecting "Add Folder to Project":

Select your `suggestotron` folder from the file picker that opens. If everything works out Sublime should show the directories of your app in a tree structure on the left:

  message <<-MARKDOWN
  You can see that `rails new` created a lot of directories and
  files. The ones we want to focus on today are:
  MARKDOWN

  table border: "1", cellspacing: "0", cellpadding: "3", align: "center" do
    tr do
      th "File/Folder"
      th "Purpose"
    end

    tr do
      td "app/"
      td "Contains the controllers, models, and views for your application.  You will do most of your work here."
    end

      td "config/"
      td "Configure your application's runtime rules, routes, database, and more."
    end

    tr do

      td "Shows your current database schema, as well as the database migrations."

      td "The only folder seen to the world as-is. If you put files in here, they will be served directly without any processing by Rails."

      td "This is where your images, JavaScript, stylesheets (CSS), and other static files should go. Modern rails apps use something called the Assets Pipeline, which combines all the JavaScript and CSS files in this directory into a single file for speediness."
