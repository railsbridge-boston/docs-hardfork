 "This is a set of step-by-step instructions for installing Ruby, Rails, and other important tools on Mac, Windows, or Linux computers. Originally developed for the [Railsbridge Workshops](http://railsbridge.org), it is a community-supported open-source documentation project. If you want to contribute, click the [git] link at the top-right corner of any page and submit your change on GitHub."
**You'll repeat all these steps tomorrow, but more slowly so you can better understand what's going on under the hood.** Today we just want to check that everything's set up and ready for tomorrow."

## You must bring:

* **Your laptop.** You need to have a working wifi connection, a browser and an email account you can readily access.
  * If you have a choice between a Mac and a Windows laptop, please bring the Mac.
  * Linux is an acceptable alternative, but the Installfest is only tested on Ubuntu.
* **Power cord for your laptop**
* If you already have accounts on Heroku or GitHub, make sure you know your username and password.

## Possibly also helpful to bring:

* Extension cord
* Power strip
* Camera
* Snacks

Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need. Bandwidth will be at a premium during the workshop, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already.

There are a lot of steps, and the instructions may seem like they're in a foreign language, but: **don't panic!** By the end of the workshop, you'll know what everything is and how to use it.

You will also create an account on Heroku, an application hosting platform.

If you already have an account on Heroku, make sure you know your username and password.


### Goal

**Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding**

At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the tools you need to write and
run Ruby code. Work through these sections in order, and ask questions if you
get stuck! That's what the TAs and instructors are here for.

When you are done with all the steps, find a TA to go through the
[checklist] with you.

[checklist]: /installfest/checklist

### 1. Set Up Your Programming Environment

First, make sure you have downloaded the files for your operating system from
the <a href="/downloads">Downloads page</a>. If you don't have them, you can get them
from a TA with a USB drive.

Then, go to the [Install your Environment](/installfest/install_environment) page
and run the installation programs for your OS.

### 2. Set up your Virtual Machine

Follow the instructions in the [VM Setup page](set_up_virtual_machine).

### 3. Try your Text Editor

You've installed Sublime Text, a text editor that is designed for coding. We have some suggestions
for using it more effectively on [this page](install_a_text_editor).

### 4. Create a Sample Application

Let's make a test application to verify that your Virtual Machine set up was successful.

### 5. Add The Project To A Git Repo

We need to configure your machine for version control. Let's walk through the steps here: <a href="/installfest/add_the_project_to_a_git_repo">Get Set up for Git</a>

### 6. Deploy your App to Heroku

Time to get our app up on the internet! Get started with Heroku: <a href="/installfest/deploying_to_heroku">Deploy Your App to Heroku</a>

### 7. Setup Checklist

Find a TA and run through the
[Installfest Completion Checklist](checklist).
