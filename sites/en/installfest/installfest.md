**You'll repeat all these steps tomorrow, but more slowly so you can better understand what's going on under the hood.** Today we just want to check that everything's set up and ready for tomorrow."

There are a lot of steps, and the instructions may seem like they're in a foreign language, but: **don't panic!** By the end of the workshop, you'll know what everything is and how to use it.


### Goal

**Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding**

At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the tools you need to write and
run Ruby code. Work through these sections in order, and ask questions if you
get stuck! That's what the TAs and instructors are here for.

When you are done with all the steps, find a TA to go through the
[checklist] with you.

### 1. Set Up Your Programming Environment

First, make sure you have downloaded the files for your operating system from
the <a href="/downloads">Downloads page</a>.

Then, go to the [Install your Environment](/installfest/install_environment) page
and run the installation programs for your OS.

### 2. Set up your Virtual Machine

Follow the instructions in the [VM Setup page](set_up_virtual_machine).

### 3. Try your Text Editor

You've installed Sublime Text, a text editor that is designed for coding. We have some suggestions
for using it more effectively on [this page](install_a_text_editor).

### 4. Create a Sample Application

Let's make a test application to verify that your Virtual Machine set up was successful.
