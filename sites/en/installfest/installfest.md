### Goal
Install Ruby, Install a Text Editor, and Start Coding

At the end of this tutorial, you will have all the tools you need to write and
run Ruby code. Work through these sections in order, and ask questions if you
get stuck! That's what the TAs and instructors are here for.

When you are done with all the steps, find a staff member to go through the
checklist with you.

### 1. Set Up Your Programming Environment

First, make sure you have downloaded the files for your operating system from
the <a href="/downloads">Downloads page</a>. If you don't have them, you can get them
from a TA with a USB drive.

Choose the instructions below for your operating system. This will take you to
a new page. Use your browser's back button to return here. Most students will
have one of the operating systems in this row.

<table class="downloads-files">
  <tr>
    <th>Mac OS X (10.6+)</th>
    <th>Windows (7+)</th>
    <th>Windows (XP-Vista)</th>
    <th>Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/osx">Mac OS X Setup</a> instructions</td>
    <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/windows_7">Windows (7+) Setup</a> instructions</td>
    <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/windows_xp">Windows Setup</a> instructions</td>
    <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/linux">Linux Setup</a> instructions</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you have one of the operating systems in the next row below, let a TA know,
in case we need to offer extra assistance.

<table class="downloads-files">
<tr>
  <th>Mac OS X (10.4-10.5)</th>
  <th>Linux (Other Distributions)</th>
  <th>ChromeOS (Chromebook)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/osx_novm">Mac OS X non-VM Setup</a> instructions</td>
  <td>Follow the <a href="/installfest/linux_novm">Linux non-VM Setup</a> instructions</td>
  <td>Ask a TA</a>
</tr>
</table>

### 2. Set up your Virtual Machine

Follow the instructions in the [VM Setup page](set_up_virtual_machine).

### 3. Try your Text Editor

You've installed a text editor that is designed for coding. Here are some
suggestions for using it more effectively: [Text Editor](install_a_text_editor)

### 4. Setup Checklist

Find a staff member and run through the
[Installfest Completion Checklist](checklist).
