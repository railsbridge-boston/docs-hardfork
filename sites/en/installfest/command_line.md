## Finding and Using the Command Line

Finding the command line is a little diffrent for each operating system.
The first step is to find the program that will allow you to access your
computer's command line.

### OS X

You can find the Terminal application through Spotlight (click the
magnifying glass in the top right of the screen and start typing
"Terminal"), or navigate to `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal` in Finder.

### Windows

Launch Git Bash via the shortcut on your Desktop, or locate **Git Bash**
in All Programs under Git. A new (mostly black) window will open.
Tip: Hit the Insert key to paste text into Git Bash. You will not be able
to copy and paste text into Git Bash when you are interacting with the
virtual machine.

### Linux

* Ubuntu: Click the Ubuntu logo and start typing "Terminal".
* Fedora: From the Main Menu bar select "Applications > System Tools > Terminal".

## Connecting to the VM

You'll use this command line to connect to your virtual machine. The VM
has its own command line inside.

## Using the Command line

You can read the slides for the <a href="/workshop/command_line">Command Line
Intro</a> presentation. If you finish that, there's some
[Command Line Extra Credit](command_line_extra_credit).

Otherwise, return to <a href="/installfest/set_up_virtual_machine">setting up the virtual machine</a>.
