## Finding and Using the Command Line

Finding the command line is a little diffrent for each operating system.
The first step is to find the program that will allow you to access your
computer's command line.

### OS X

You can find the Terminal application through Spotlight (click the
magnifying glass in the top right of the screen and start typing
"Terminal"), or navigate to `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal` in Finder.

### Windows

Launch the Git Shell. You can find a shortcut on your Desktop (grey
circle with a cat), or locate **Git Shell** in All Programs under
GitHub. A new (mostly black) window will open.

### Linux

* Ubuntu: Click the Ubuntu logo and start typing "Terminal".
* Fedora: From the Main Menu bar select "Applications > System Tools > Terminal".

## Connecting to the VM

You'll use this command line to connect to your virtual machine. The VM
has its own command line inside.
