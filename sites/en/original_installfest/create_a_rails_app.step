      Throughout your Rails programming career you're going to type `rails server` a
      lot.  In fact, you'll type this so much that DHH and the Rails Core team

      is the same as `rails server`.

    Wait until your console shows that the Webrick server has started (just like before).  Then, in the browser, visit <http://localhost:3000/drinks>

    1. Click on "New drink"
    2. Enter Cappuccino for the name
    3. Enter 135 for the temperature.
    4. Click on "Create Drink".

    (The window where you ran `rails server` will display debugging information as you do this.)
