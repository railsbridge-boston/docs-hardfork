  message <<-MARKDOWN
    At the core, most database driven web sites are the same. They need to store records and provide a way to do the following:

    * **C**reate new records in the database
    * **R**ead or show the records in the database
    * **U**pdate existing records
    * **D**estroy or delete records

    Because these 4 actions (CRUD) are so common, Rails includes the scaffold command to make creating them easier.

    console "rails server -b0.0.0.0"

    message "Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000/topics](http://localhost:3000/topics)"
    message 'You should see the "Listing Topics" page with headers for title and description, and a link to add a new topic:'

    img src: "img/Seattle_topic_list_page.png", alt: "Screenshot of topic list page"
  end

  step do
    message <<-MARKDOWN
  * Click on "New Topic"
  * Fill in the form and click "Create Topic"
  * You should see a page showing your new topic with a message that your topic was successfully created:
    MARKDOWN

    img alt: "Screenshot of topic detail page with confirmation message", src: "img/Seattle_topic_created.png"
  end

  step do
    message <<-MARKDOWN
      * Click on "Back"
      * You should see the topic list again, this time with your new topic listed:

      ![Screenshot of topic list with new topic](img/Seattle_list_with_topic.png)

      * Try the "show", "edit", and "destroy" links to see what they do
      * You've created a basic database-driven web site. Congratulations!

  How did all those pages get created and hooked together? rails scaffold did it for you.
