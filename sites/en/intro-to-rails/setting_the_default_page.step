  Now that the structure is complete, let's make the flow work smoothly.

  Currently when you go to <http://localhost:3000> you see the "Yay! You’re on Rails!" message.

  It would be easier to use our app if <http://localhost:3000> went directly to the topics list.

  In this step we'll make that happen and learn a bit about routes in Rails.

    message "Search the file for the line `resources :topics`. It will be near the top."

  step "Remove the comment (optional)" do
    message <<-MARKDOWN
      Near the bottom, there is a line that starts with a `#`. This is called a
      comment. It is ignored by ruby and is used for reference or further
      explanation of nearby code. If you want, you can remove it, or keep it
      there to look at later. It's totally up to you!

explanation do
 message <<-MARKDOWN
    * `root 'topics#index'` is a Rails route that says the default
      address for your site is `topics#index`. `topics#index` is the topics
      list page (the topics controller with the index action).
    * Rails routes control how URLs (web addresses) get matched with
      code on the server. Similar to how addresses match with houses and
      apartments.
    * The file `config/routes.rb` is like an address directory listing the
      possible addresses and which code goes with each one.
    * `routes.rb` uses some shortcuts so it doesn't always show all the
      possible URLs. To explore the URLs in more detail we can use the
      terminal.

    At the terminal type `rails routes`. You should get something that
    looks like this:
  MARKDOWN

  console_without_message <<-CONSOLE
$ rails routes

    Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                Controller#Action
      root GET    /                          topics#index
    topics GET    /topics(.:format)          topics#index
           POST   /topics(.:format)          topics#create
 new_topic GET    /topics/new(.:format)      topics#new
edit_topic GET    /topics/:id/edit(.:format) topics#edit
     topic GET    /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#show
           PATCH  /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#update
           PUT    /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#update
           DELETE /topics/:id(.:format)      topics#destroy
  CONSOLE

  message <<-MARKDOWN
    This shows all the URLs your application responds to. The code that starts
    with colons are variables so `:id` means the id number of the record. The
    code in parentheses is optional.

    You can also get this information on your site in development. Go to
    <http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes> 
  MARKDOWN
    cloud9_instruction do
      simple_link " https://<your-preview-url>.amazonaws.com/rails/info/routes"
    end
  <<-MARKDOWN
    and you'll see something like this:

    <img src='img/rails4_rails_info_routing.png' alt='Screenshot of browser-based Rails routing info page'>

    You'll also see that table whenever you try to access an invalid route,
    like <http://localhost:3000/sandwich>.
  MARKDOWN

  step "Exploring Routes (optional)" do
    message <<-MESSAGE
      Now you can have a look at the paths that are available in your app.
      Let's try looking at one of the topics routes we just generated.
      Open up your rails console and play:
    MESSAGE

    console_without_message "$ rails console"

    irb_without_message <<-IRB
      > app.topics_path
      => "/topics"
      > app.topics_url
      => "http://www.example.com/topics"
    IRB

    message "`app` is a special object that represents your entire application.
    You can ask it about its routes (as we just did), play with its
    database connections, or make pseudo-web requests against it with
    `get` or `post` (and lots more)."
  end
end
