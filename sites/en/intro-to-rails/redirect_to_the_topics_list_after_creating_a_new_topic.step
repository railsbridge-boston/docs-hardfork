  When a user creates a new topic, or edits an existing topic, they are
  currently shown a page with just that topic. For our voting app it makes
  more sense that they would be taken back to the topic list.

  In this step we'll change the flow of our app so that the user is taken back to the topics list after they add a new topic (create) or
  edit an existing topic (update).

explanation do
  message <<-MARKDOWN
    Let's look at the following code snippet, piece by piece:

    ```ruby
    format.html { redirect_to topics_path, notice: 'Topic was successfully created.' }
    ```

    * `format.html` means that the server should send html back to the browser
    * `redirect_to topics_path` means show the **topics list page** when we're done creating or updating a topic
    * `notice: 'Topic was successfully created/updated.'` puts the message into the flash so it will be displayed on the topics list. You can see the flash message at the very top of `app/views/topics/index.html.erb`
