Let's look at the structure of the whole project.

You can see the project directory when you're using Sublime Text. This is
convenient when you're going to edit several files and want to navigate quickly.

Open the suggestotron folder as a project in Sublime Text by clicking the
Project menu and selecting "Add Folder to Project":

Select your `suggestotron` folder from the file picker that opens. If everything works out Sublime should show the directories of your app in a tree structure on the left:

  message <<-MARKDOWN
  You can see that `rails new` created a lot of directories and
  files. The ones we want to focus on today are:
  MARKDOWN

  table border: "1", cellspacing: "0", cellpadding: "3", align: "center" do
    tr do
      th "File/Folder"
      th "Purpose"
