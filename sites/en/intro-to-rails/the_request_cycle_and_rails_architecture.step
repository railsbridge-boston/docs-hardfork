  h2 "Model View Controller (MVC) Architecture"

  message "Rails implements a very specific notion of the **Model/View/Controller** pattern, which guides how you structure your web applications."

  h3 "Model"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * The Model is a bridge between the database and your application's code.
  * For all the Models we create in RailsBridge, Model objects have a corresponding record in the the database. The name of the table in the database is the plural version of the Model's class name.

  **Let's take a look at the Topic Model in suggestotron:**
    * `app/models/topic.rb`
  MARKDOWN

  h3 "View"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * The View generates the HTML that will be displayed in the browser.
  * View files are written in ERB, a templating language. It contains HTML with Ruby code embedded in it. The ruby variables in the view stand as placeholders for content that will be filled in when a user requests the page.
  **Let's take a look at the View files in suggestotron, and match each View file with the corresponding page in the browser:**
    * `app/views/topics/index.html.erb`
    * `app/views/topics/show.html.erb`
    * `app/views/topics/new.html.erb`
    * `app/views/topics/edit.html.erb`
    * `app/views/topics/_form.html.erb`

  You may have noticed that the page for new topics and the page to edit topics looked similar. That's because they both use the
  code from this file to show a form. This file is called a
  partial since it only contains code for part of a page. Partials
  always have filenames starting with an underscore character.

  **Challenge question:** Can you find the line of code in `new.html.erb`
    and `edit.html.erb` that makes the form partial appear?
  MARKDOWN

  h3 "Controller"
  message <<-MARKDOWN
  * Controllers pass Ruby objects between the Models and the Views.
  * When you visit any page in your application, that request will be handled by a method in a Controller.

  **Let's take a look at the Controller file in suggestotron:**
    * `app/controllers/topics_controller.rb`

  You'll see a method (a line beginning with
      <code>def</code>) for each of the views listed above (except
      _form.html.erb).

    Walk through the process of creating a new topic in your browser.  At each step, identify how the topic model, topic controller, and topic views are working together.
