# Downloading XCode

First, create a free Apple developer account. Go to the
[Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/downloads), and
click Register. Fill out the first page with your account information.
The second page is a developer survey, which you can skip. Just go to
the bottom and click "Continue".

Confirm your account and log in.

# OS X 10.5

Download
[Xcode 3.1.4](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/download.action?path=Developer_Tools/xcode_3.1.4_developer_tools/xcode314_2809_developerdvd.dmg)
from the Apple Developer Center.

If that link doesn't work, go to the
[downloads page](https://developer.apple.com/downloads) and search for
"Xcode 3.1.4".

# Other versions

If you have an older version of OS X, ask a TA for help. If you have a
newer version of OS X but still want to use this installation method
(**not** necessary if you are using the virtual machine), get XCode from
the App Store.

You are now ready to [for the Installfest](/installfest/osx_novm)!
