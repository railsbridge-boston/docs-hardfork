# Downloads

If you can, please download these files onto your laptop computer before
you attend the workshop. There will be an internet connection there
(provided by our wonderful location sponsor!), but it's not fast enough
for everyone to download large files at the same time.

If you can't download the files ahead of time, we will also have the
files available on USB drives at the Installfest.

## Common Operating Systems

Almost everyone will have one of these operating systems. If you're not
sure what version you have, do this:

* **Mac OS X**: Click on the Apple menu and then "About This Mac".
* **Windows**: Go to this page: [Which Windows operating system am I running?](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-operating-system)

Find the column for your OS, and download each file.

<strong>Important</strong>: Please download these files even if you have been to a previous workshop. Versions have changed.

When you come to the workshop, you will use these files to set up the
RailsBridge virtual machine.

## Other Operating Systems

Please create an account on <a href="https://c9.io">Cloud9</a>. You will be asked for a credit card, but you won't be charged anything for using it in this workshop.

**MAC AND LINUX EXPERTS:** if you prefer, you can use these methods to
install Ruby natively on your computer, without a virtual machine,
even on supported versions of Mac OS X or Linux.
