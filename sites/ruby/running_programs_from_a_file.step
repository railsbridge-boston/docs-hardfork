message <<-INTRO
irb isn't a good tool for writing long programs.  Code is entered one line at a time. You can\'t save your work, and you can't share it when you're done. 

Most of the time we write code in a file and run it from the command line.  

For writing software, we use a program called a text editor.  A text editor is a word processor that saves in plain text format.  This is unlike Word, which saves files in a special format that only Word can read.

We may have recommended a particular text editor during the Installfest, such as SublimeText.  You can use any editor you like so long as it saves plain text.

It\'s helpful to keep your text editor running, since you\'ll be coming back to it often.

Save the file.  If you\'re using the RailsBridge virtual machine, *save the file in the same folder you created the virtual machine.* That folder is shared between your laptop and the vm, like Google Drive.

Did you notice we added  `.rb` at the end of the name? It\'s standard practice to name Ruby files this way, to help people and tools recognize the file contains Ruby code.

When you saved the file, your text editor may have added colors to the code.  It recognizes the file contains Ruby, and will mark up different kinds of words with different colors. \"Syntax highlighting\" makes it easier to read code.
